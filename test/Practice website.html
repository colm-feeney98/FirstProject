<p>Seoul, officially Seoul Special City,is the capital and largest city of South Korea.
     The broader Seoul Capital Area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon Metropolitan City, emerged as the world's sixth largest metropolitan economy in 2022, trailing behind Paris, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and New York, and hosts more than half of South Korea's population. 
     Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. 
     Seoul is the seat of the South Korean government.

    <h2>Seoul's history</h2>

    <img src="C:\Users\colmj\OneDrive\Pictures\Gyeongjoobudo.jpg" alt="Seoul history">

<p>Seoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
     During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. 
     In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed "Gyeongseong." 
     The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. 
     Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.</p>

     <h2>Where To Stay In Seoul?</h2>

     <p>Seoul is a huge city and there are many different areas to stay in depending on your interests.</p>

     <p>However, what I noticed about places to stay in Seoul, 
        is because the public transportation system is so efficient and convenient to use,
         it’s not hugely important which area you stay in (as long as you’re somewhat central), 
         because you can always get to where you need to go.</p>

    <p>Seoul has nearly 
        <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?city=-716583&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">every form of accommodation available</span></a>
    
        from modern hostels to major 5 star hotel brands. Prices for accommodation are overall quite high, but you do have plenty of options.</p>

        
        <p> <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=2420&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Jung-gu</span></a> and <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=2420&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Jongo-Gu</span></a> 
             These two districts are what I would call the most central to Seoul sightseeing and shopping and right in the heart of the downtown area of Seoul.
            You’ll find many hotels in this area and it’s a great area to stay if you want easy access to the famous attractions without spending much time on the metro. </li>  <!-- li is list item -->
            
            <li> <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=2420&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Myeondong</span></a> – Myeondong is one of the biggest shopping districts in Seoul,
                 and it’s home to lots of restaurants, hotels and trendy fashion and nightlife. 
                Stay in Myeongdong to be surrounded by shopping.</li>
            
            <li> <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=4465&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Seoul Station</span></a> (Yongsan-Gu) 
                – The area around Seoul Station is huge, and you’ll find both high end and lower end hotels. 
                There’s not so much to do or see right at Seoul Station (although it’s very close to Namdaemun market and Myeondong), but it’s convenient for transportation.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=4462&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Hongdae</span></a> (Hongik University) 
                – Hongdae is located in Western Seoul and it’s known especially for being a university town and therefore there’s plenty of shopping, restaurants, street food, and nightlife.
                 It’s overall a great local area of Seoul and a fun area to walk around and explore. 
                 There are lots of guest houses in this area, so it’s a good place to looks for budget to mid-range accommodation.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?district=2413&aid=808668" ><span style="font-weight:900">Gangnam-Gu</span>Gangnam-Gu</a>
                – Finally, there’s Gangnam, which is an area of Seoul that is known for being high end and very trendy. 
                There are some very fancy and upscale hotels in this area.</li>
        </ul></p>
    

        <h2>5 of My favourite Korean Foods</h2>

        <p>I’m a huge fan of Korean food and especially the Korean feasts where a mind-blowing array of main and side dishes are placed on the table before you.</p>

        <p>I’ve listed a few of my absolute favorite Korean foods I’ve tried so far, and dishes that you can find across Seoul and South Korea. 
            This is not an extensive list, just a samplers platter of a few of my personal favorites.</p>

            
<p> <ol>
<li> <span style="font-weight:900">Banchan</span>(side dishes) – Let’s begin with banchan, which is the name used to describe the multitude of Korean side dishes that can include all sorts of mini plates of pickles, 
    chili marinated bits, fritters, and even sometimes little bites of leftovers. 
    While a main dish might be the heart of Korean food, the banchan side dishes are the body, they make a meal function and make a meal complete.
     Kimchi is one of the most common banchan.</li>
<li> <span style="font-weight:900">Gamjatang</span> (pork bone potato stew) – This soup is made with pork spine bones and potatoes which are boiled until the meat left is fall apart tender.
     You can usually order the kimchi version, which is absolutely sensational. 
     Of all the food mentioned in this Seoul travel guide blog, this is one of my absolute favorite dishes.</li>
<li> <span style="font-weight:900">Gogigui</span> (all things grilled meat) – One of the ultimate Korean meals are pieces of meat,
     grilled on your table before you with all the side dishes and dipping sauces.
     Korean barbecue is incredibly delicious.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:900">Sundubu Jjigae</span> (kimchi stew) – Mainly made with un-curdled tofu and lots of red chili flakes, sundubu jjiggae is both spicy and richly flavorful. 
    The tofu is so good it almost tastes likes scrambled eggs.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:900">Mandu</span> (dumplings) – Many cultures around the world have some kind of dumpling, and in Korea, mandu are meat and vegetable filled dumpling pockets.
     They can either be steamed or deep fried, and they are delicious either way.</li>
